# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML,CSS and JAVA SCRIPT. This is a two-player game where players take turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O" until one of the players wins or the game results in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Players alternate turns to mark their positions on the board.
- **Win condition**: The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Draw condition**: The game will end in a draw if the board is full and no player has won.
